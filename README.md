# Among The Darkness

## Core Concept
A dark fantasy roguelike RPG where you awaken in a procedurally generated dungeon maze with no memory of how you arrived. An entity called **Manifestation** has sensed your presence and is slowly hunting you through the corridors. Collect scattered memories, learn about your past and forge your fate.

## Characters

### Main Character
**Ash Thornfield** is a 24 year old lady who finds herself in a bizarre and hostile world. She doesn't seem to recall anything, her memory is lost. Ash went through a traumatic life event (car crash leading to passing of her fiance. She blames herself for everything.) and is suffering severe depression. She's wandering around, trying to find information about herself and this place, but she doesn't yet realize that everything around her is her own mind's creation. Ash used to like reading a lot of books when she was a child and was a die hard fan of fantasy stories. The world created by her mind received it's darker tone due to the current state of her mental health. 

### Soul Embodiment (Side Characters)
**Thunder (courage), Aeris (determination), Selene (resilience), Vivian (curiosity), Rain (cowardice), Serephine (despair), Mist (fragility), Ivy (indifference)** are side characters that Ash will meet throughout her journey representing personality traits. Depending on the outcome of their interractions she will face a different fate. 

### Reminiscence (Friendly NPCs)
- **Miriam the Cartographer** - Sells map fragments that unlock new maze sections, allowing progression
- **Dusk the Knight** - Offers Soul Cards in exchange for Tear Drops (currency)
- **Sister Celeste** - Heals you in exchange for Tear Drops
- **Wandering Mask** - Gives out location of hidden bosses that drop Legendary Soul Cards
- **Echo (Mysterious Child having ghost like appearance)** - Speaks in riddles about Manifestation's nature

### Main Enemy
**Manifestation (name changed to "The Hollow Veil" later in the story)** is the main enemy in the game that cannot be stricken down until a certain turning point when Ash will have to face it. It will be revealed that **Manifestation** is a part of Ash herself, representing her trauma and self hatred. 


## Gameplay Loop

### Manifestation
- **** spawns at a distant point in the maze and begins methodically tracking the player
- Visual/audio cues intensify as it gets closer (distant footsteps, walls trembling, shadows growing longer)
- Manifestation moves in real-time but slowlyâ€”creating constant tension without rushing the player
- If encountered too early in the story, Manifestation is *nearly* invincible, forcing retreat or death

### Combat & Progression (RPG Elements)
- **Smaller enemies** (The Lost One) patrol the area and dealing damage during encounters
- Real time combat system via Soul Cards
- Defeating The Lost One grants:
  - **Essence** (points to enhance Soul Cards stats)
  - **Memory Shard** (points to unlock active skills)
  - **Tear Drop** (currency, used with merchant NPCs)
  - **Soul Card (with a small drop rate)** (weapon)

### Soul Cards
- Used as a weapon
- Have static main stat and modifiable sub stat
- Card Overlapping: merge 2 cards of same rarity to obtain 1 card having sub stats from 2 merged cards 
- Card Incineration: discard a card to obtain Essence at a lowered rate
- Card Rarity: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary. Common rarity cards drop most often and are the weakest while legendary cards are hidden behind a mini boss and can only be obtained once. Legendary cards have highest main stat and have a special effect (creating burning zone, freezing, pulling enemies in etc)

### Three Different Endings

**Wake up, Ash Thornfield. (True Ending)**
- Choosing right dialogue options with each of the Soul Embodiments Ash realizes the true nature of Manifestation (name changed to The Hollow Veil)
- Ash confronts The Hollow Veil and defeats it
- Ash comes out from the state of psychosis and begins to work on herself, fixing her life

**I am the strongest! (Neutral Ending)**
- Choosing equivalent amount of right and wrong dialogue options Ash doesn't uncover who Manifestation truly is
- Ash still defeats Manifestation
- Ash remains in the imaginary world feeding up her delusions (the game doesn't reveal that to the player)

**Lost in The Woods (Bad Ending)**
- Choosing bad dialogue options Ash progressively loses motivation 
- She succumbs to her negative thoughts and lets Manifestation devour her
- It is revealed that Ash shot herself in real life

**How did we get here? (Secret Ending)**
- Defeat Manifestation earlier than intended
- The game throws a fake error, deletes all progress and crashes

## Maze Design

### Procedural Generation
- Grid-based maze with hand-crafted room templates
- Themes: prison cells, torture chambers, ancient libraries, ritual halls, collapsed tunnels
- Each run features:
  - Different layout
  - Randomized NPC locations
  - Variable mob spawn points
  - Shuffled loot locations

### Environmental Storytelling
- Bloodstains, scratch marks on walls, skeletal remains
- Faded journals revealing Ash's past
- Arcane symbols that hint at maze rules
- Breakable walls hiding shortcuts or treasure

### NPC Interactions
- Dialogue trees with choices affecting the final outcome
- Can barter items, services, or information
- Some NPCs have their own mini-quests

## Atmospheric Features

### Tension Mechanics
- **Sanity system**: Spending too long near Manifestation decreases sanity, causing visual distortions and taunting audio hallucinations
- **Light sources**: Lantern reveals more area around but attracts The Lost Ones; darkness hides you from Manifestation
- **Sound design**: Dripping water, distant screams, Manifestation's breathing growing louder

### Dynamic Events
- The Lost Ones swarm when staying in one area too long
- Environmental hazards (collapsing floors, poison gas rooms)

## Replayability (if we have enough time)
- Hardcore mode with stronger enemies, less resources and even lower survivability
