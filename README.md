# Shadow Labyrinth: Descent into the Hollowed Keep

## Core Concept
A dark fantasy roguelike RPG where you awaken in a procedurally generated dungeon maze with no memory of how you arrived. A powerful entity called **The Warden** has sensed your presence and is slowly hunting you through the corridors. You must choose your path: grow strong enough to defeat it, escape before it finds you, or discover the truth of why you're trapped here.

## Characters (wip)
- **Ash Thornfield** is a 24 year old girl who finds herself in a bizzarre and hostile world. She doesn't seem to recall anything, her memory is lost. Ash went through a traumatic life event (tbd) and is suffering severe depression. She's wandering around, trying to find information about herself and this place, but she doesn't yet realize that everything around her is her own mind's creation. Ash used to like reading a lot of books when she was a child and was a die hard fan of fantasy stories. The world created by her mind received it's darker tone due to the current state of her mental health.

## Gameplay Loop

### The Hunt Mechanic
- **** spawns at a distant point in the maze and begins methodically tracking you
- Visual/audio cues intensify as it gets closer (distant footsteps, walls trembling, shadows growing longer)
- The Warden moves in real-time but slowly—creating constant tension without rushing the player
- If encountered too early, The Warden is nearly invincible, forcing retreat or death

### Combat & Progression (RPG Elements)
- **Smaller enemies** ("Hollows") patrol the maze—corrupted souls trapped like you
- Turn-based or real-time with pause combat system
- Defeating Hollows grants:
  - **Essence** (experience points)
  - **Memory Fragments** (skill points)
  - **Equipment** (weapons, armor, talismans)
- Level up stats: Strength, Vitality, Arcane, Agility
- Skill trees based on playstyle (warrior, mage, rogue, hybrid)

### The Three Paths to Victory

**Path 1: The Conqueror**
- Farm Hollows until reaching **Level 15+** with proper gear
- Confront The Warden in a challenging boss fight
- Unlock true ending: "The Warden's Crown"

**Path 2: The Escapist**
- Navigate the maze efficiently using map fragments and NPC hints
- Find the **Exit Seal** (hidden in a specific maze region)
- Requires solving environmental puzzles to unlock it
- Unlock ending: "Freedom's Price"

**Path 3: The Seeker** (Hidden Path)
- Collect all **5 Lore Tablets** scattered in the maze
- Learn the truth: you and The Warden are connected
- Unlock special ritual to merge/banish The Warden without fighting
- Unlock ending: "Remembered Truth"

## Maze Design

### Procedural Generation
- Grid-based maze with hand-crafted room templates
- Themes: prison cells, torture chambers, ancient libraries, ritual halls, collapsed tunnels
- Each run features:
  - Different layout
  - Randomized NPC locations
  - Variable Hollow spawn points
  - Shuffled loot/tablet locations

### Environmental Storytelling
- Bloodstains, scratch marks on walls, skeletal remains
- Faded journals revealing previous victims' attempts
- Arcane symbols that hint at maze rules
- Breakable walls hiding shortcuts or treasure

## NPC System

### The Lost Ones (Friendly NPCs)
Non-aggressive souls who retain some humanity:

1. **Miriam the Cartographer** - Sells map fragments showing maze sections
2. **Dusk the Hollow Knight** - Offers combat training (respec points)
3. **Sister Celeste** - Heals you in exchange for Memory Fragments
4. **The Chronicler** - Trades lore tablets' locations for rare items
5. **Echo (Mysterious Child)** - Speaks in riddles about The Warden's nature

### NPC Interactions
- Dialogue trees with choices affecting relationships
- Can barter items, services, or information
- Some NPCs have their own mini-quests
- Certain NPCs reveal they're not as "friendly" as they seem (late-game twist potential)

## Atmospheric Features

### Tension Mechanics
- **Sanity system**: Spending too long near The Warden decreases sanity, causing visual distortions
- **Light sources**: Torches reveal more but attract Hollows; darkness hides you from The Warden
- **Sound design**: Dripping water, distant screams, The Warden's breathing growing louder

### Dynamic Events
- Hollow swarms when staying in one area too long
- Environmental hazards (collapsing floors, poison gas rooms)
- "Safe rooms" where The Warden cannot enter (limited)

## Replayability
- Multiple character classes with unique starting abilities
- Daily/weekly challenge mazes with leaderboards
- Unlockable modifiers (harder enemies, limited healing, permadeath mode)
- New Game+ with stronger Warden and hidden secret areas
